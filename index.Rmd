I'm a Statistician by training. I'm interested in learning about open source and open science.


##### Open-source projects

1. Written the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/) in 2021 as a project funded by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/). Mentor: Heather Turner, Michael Lawrence.

2. Completed the [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://gist.github.com/SaranjeetKaur/37086fea06076bd3ec76d052cc166378) with the Turing team of the Julia language organisation. Mentor: Hong Ge, Cameron Pfiffer, Miles Lucas.

3. Created Zine for CarpenPi organization with a funding from the Data Science by Design (DSxD) initiative. 


##### Conference presentations

1. [Lightning talk at PackagingCon 2021](https://youtu.be/BpRef4U-4sI?t=121): Presented a lightning talk on “Turing.jl: An Overview”. The talk was an overview of Turing.jl which is a Julia library focusing on Bayesian inference with probabilistic programming. This was the first edition of PackagingCon 2021, which is a conference held with the aim to bring various software eco-systems together. 

2. [Invited talk at LatinR 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPia_PAxvw): Presented a Invited talk on “R Development Guide: Motivation, First Draft, and the Way Forward”. This is a Latinamerican conference about the use of R in R&D.

3. [Virtual poster presentation at JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7SYF3wbXwk): I presented a virtual poster of my work based on ‘Algorithmic Variants of Nested Sampling’. I developed these algorithms while working for the Google Summer of Code 2020 with the Turing team of the Julia Language organization. I also moderated the single track sessions of JuliaCon 2021.

4. [Regular talk at useR! 2021 - The R Conference](https://youtu.be/2B7H8WJOX40?t=2187https://youtu.be/2B7H8WJOX40?t=2187): In the ‘1A Community and Outreach 1’ session on the ‘R Developer’s Guide’ (now called as the 'R Development Guide'). During the conference, I also attended the tutorials on ‘Contributing to R’ (conducted by Gabriel Becker and Martin Maechler) and ‘Translating R to Your Language’ (conducted by Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence). I was also the Zoom Host 
for various tutorials and sessions of this international online conference.
