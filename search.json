    "text": "Description\n\nDescription\nThe R Development Guide (R Dev Guide) serves as a comprehensive resource to facilitate the onboarding process for new contributors to the R project. Its initial draft emerged in 2021 which was made possible through a funding from the R Foundation. Subsequently, a significant update took place during Google Season of Docs (GSoD) 2022. This update involved the inclusion of new chapters and sections, addressing important aspects such as translations, adopting a git workflow for proposed patches, and providing novice-friendly instructions on installing R from source. Work has continued post-GSoD 2022, to implement further updates and improvements, many in response to feedback on earlier versions. This talk reviews the current status of the guide, shedding light on the positive impact it has had on the R community, particularly among new contributors. With the enhancements to the Guide, contributing has become more accessible, especially for newcomers, compared to relying solely on the official documentation. The talk aims to showcase the evolving nature of the guide and underscore its role in fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for those engaging with the R project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Also posted on Software Sustainability Institute’s blog.\nAttending the 55th Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) meeting was a remarkable experience for me as it was my first time attending an in-person APAN meeting as an APAN Fellow. Even though I had participated in APAN53 online before, the opportunity to attend the in-person meeting held in Kathmandu, Nepal provided a distinctive experience. Day 1 of the APAN55 meeting started with Delegate registration. Following this I participated in the APAN 101 gathering, where Markus Buchhorn from Australia served as host and provided an overview of APAN and its Fellowship program. Markus explained how APAN came into existence in 1995 and was established in 2009 as a partnership between various National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) that support research and education in various regions by linking universities, higher education institutions, government agencies, and providing resources such as supercomputers and cloud infrastructure. He also discussed the APAN structure, which includes working groups, task forces, and committees that form the backbone of the organisation. Additionally, he described the activities that typically occur during an APAN meeting, which has evolved into a conference, such as working group and committee sessions, plenaries, keynotes, general assembly, social events, workshops, side meetings, and the council meeting. This session offered me valuable insights into the APAN meetings. Following this, I attended the RPKI Theory + Hands-On tutorial session, led by Dibya Khatiwada from Nepal. This session covered IP routing and Validation States, which was a new topic for me. I gained some insights into the technical jargon and field of IP routing.\n\n\n\n(From left to right and top to bottom): Welcome to APAN55 banner, Registration for APAN55, My ID Card for APAN55, Markus Buchhorn providing an overview of APAN, Dibya Khatiwada leading the RPKI Theory + Hands-On tutorial session.\n\n\nLater on, I joined a session hosted by the Cloud Working Group (CloudWG). During this session, Eric Yen from Taiwan presented an update on Science Cloud in Academia Sinica. Eric explained that the mission of the CloudWG is to promote and share the development of Cloud-based ICT technology and applications. He also described the CloudWG as an open collaboration platform that enables the sharing of case studies, solutions, technologies, and user community requirements, as well as collaboration between user communities and other Working Groups at APAN. Eric shared the vision of an Open Science Cloud that aims to drive transformative discoveries in all areas of S&E research and education through community-driven, research-focused, accessible, open, transparent, and trustworthy means. Eric concluded by inviting participants to collaborate with their group.\nJongWon Kim from South Korea presented a discussion on “Preparing Cloud-native & Data-centric Computing for Live X+AI Services.” The discussion focused on how to prepare for a futuristic computing environment to enable seamless live interaction of training and inference for emerging X+AI services. The ongoing preparation aligns with the upcoming digital transformation and leverages the latest trends for cloud-native and data-centric edge computing paradigms to facilitate open and federated collaboration of diversified R&D communities.\nLastly, Mir Muhammad Suleman Sarwar from South Korea spoke on IBN for overlay networks in Cloud Intent-Based Networking (IBN) for deploying and managing L2 overlay networks such as GENEVE tunnels between OpenStack based multiple clouds. The discussion centred on how multiple clouds use the overlay network to share resources and how the IBN application can deploy microstack-based OpenStack Clouds by providing system credentials, after which a network administrator can deploy an overlay network between all the Cloud nodes using the IBN application based on ML results. The session provided a valuable opportunity for me to learn more about the CloudWG at APAN and the developments and updates presented in the session.\n\n\n\nPresentations at the Cloud Working Group Session\n\n\nOn day one, I wrapped up my schedule by attending the session titled “iFIRExMAN - Setting up eduroam in your federation infrastructure,” which was hosted by Irfan Hakim and Muhammad Farhan Sjaugi from Malaysia. The session discussed how to set up and configure a Radius service using the same Kubernetes infrastructure as one’s identity federation. This Radius service would serve as the central point for all eduroam authentication in a country and could also be used to connect to the global Radius infrastructure. This would enable researchers, staff, and students to access resources globally and also allow international researchers to access resources while travelling in other countries.\nDuring day 2, I attended the session “iFIRExMAN - Setting up eduroam in your federation infrastructure” again, which was hosted by Irfan Hakim and Muhammad Farhan Sjaugi from Malaysia. This session was followed by a talk by Terry Smith from Australia on “iFIRExMAN - Joining eduGAIN”. The latter session discussed eduGAIN, which is a federation of federations providing access to millions of identities and thousands of services. I learned that connecting a federation to eduGAIN could encourage universities and research institutions to join the federation. Terry Smith’s talk covered the process of joining eduGAIN, its benefits, expectations from members, and the potential challenges that one may encounter.\n\n\n\niFIRExMAN and eduGAIN sessions\n\n\nOn day 2, the organisers hosted the Opening Ceremony and Opening Keynote, delivered by Dr Arun Bhakta Shreshtha and Purnima Shreshtha. During the ceremony, a Memorandum of Understanding for KISTI - Asia-Pacific Europe Ring was signed. Both Keynote speakers focused on the impact of climate change on the Himalayan region. Dr Arun Bhakta Sheshtha emphasised the global importance of the Hindu Kush Himalaya or the Third Pole, with its monsoon-dominated climate providing essential resources such as food, energy, water, and carbon, as well as significant cultural and biological diversity. Meanwhile, Purnima Shreshtha shared insights into the life of the Himalayan people.\n\n\n\n(From top to bottom) Opening Keynote by Dr Arun Bhakta Shreshtha and Purnima Shreshtha, Signing of MoU for KISTI - Asia-Pacific Europe Ring\n\n\nFollowing the Opening Ceremony and Keynote, I participated in a session called “The IPv4/IPv6 Joint Research Project Updates”. During this session, a review of the joint IPv6 project was presented by Changqing An from Beijing. Qianli Zhang from Tsinghua University delivered a report on global cyberspace surveying and mapping. Mohammad Tawrit from Dhaka presented a review of his participation in the BGP watch portal, while Dhammika Lalantha from Sri Lanka discussed the user experience and offered suggestions for improving the BGP watch platform.\nDuring day 3 of the event, I gave a presentation entitled “Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association: Journey and Future Plans” at the “Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG): Asia Pacific Open-Sharing Data and NRENs Open Science” session. Mehul Raval also gave a presentation on initiatives for open data creation and sharing at Ahmedabad University, and Markus Buchhorm from Australia spoke about implementing good practices from Australian Open Science in the APAN community. Additionally, I shared swag for the RSE Asia Association and the Open Life Science programme, which were sponsored by the Open Life Science programme. During the session, I also conducted a task in which participants were asked to share their ideas on Research Software Engineering as a career path and how open science could benefit researchers globally. I collected the responses and compiled them into a Twitter thread, tagging those who gave permission and maintaining anonymity for those who requested it. Later, I attended the IAM Task Force - eduGAIN Steering Group meeting, which was led by Terry Smith.\n\n\n\n(From left to right) RSE Asia Association swags, My presentation about the RSE Asia Association\n\n\n\n\n\n(From left to right) I conducted a task for the RSE Asia Association, Twitter thread about the task\n\n\nDuring Day 4, I spent time distributing swag and interacting with participants. Later, I attended the APAN55 Council Meeting, which was led by Markus Buchhorn. During the meeting, I learned about several updates taking place at APAN. Markus announced that Liana Jacinta would be the new General Manager of APAN and Shaan Sivagurunathan would be the new Secretariat of APAN, in addition to renewals of several agreements at APAN. There were also discussions about potential areas for improvement at APAN and how the community could contribute to those efforts.\n\n\n\nMarkus Buchhorn presenting at the APAN55 Council meeting\n\n\nDuring another session on “Sustaining NREN Services for the Future - FileSender and more,” I had the opportunity to hear from Ben Martin, the Lead Developer of FileSender, who discussed the roadmap for FileSender v3 and how it could benefit the research and education community. Brook Schofield from the FileSender.Asia project also presented on how the project could benefit NRENs and how to ensure its sustainability in the long term. The fourth day of the event concluded with a closing social dinner, during which I met Andrew Howard from National Computational Infrastructure, Canberra. Andrew was gracious enough to introduce me to several attendees and we discussed the potential for future collaborations with the RSE Asia Association.\n\n\n\n(From left to right) Presentation by the FileSender.Asia project, Myself with Andrew Howard at the closing social dinner\n\n\nDuring the last day of APAN55, I participated in the closing plenary. Among the speakers was Eric Huizer, CEO of GEANT, who discussed the importance of fostering community spirit, promoting service, and encouraging innovation in the global REN community. He emphasised the principles of doing good, doing right, and doing better to achieve these goals. Afterwards, there was a session titled “Sensitising on the Potential of Research and Education Networks,” which aimed to raise awareness among universities and other knowledge communities about the potential benefits of research and education networks. This session was open to APAN participants and featured senior officials from various universities and colleges in Nepal. Leaders from different NRENs also participated and shared their activities to inform and educate the local attendees.\nThe General Assembly marked the final session of APAN55, during which several important announcements were made. One such announcement was the official appointment of Liana Jacinta as the new General Manager of APAN. Rajan Parajuli from the Nepal Research and Education Network gave a brief overview of the conference and its origins, and also shared how they planned to host the first in-person and online APAN meeting, post-pandemic. Additionally, the APAN55 fellows were presented with certificates during the General Assembly. Finally, the hosts of the next meeting, APAN56, were invited onto the stage to launch the event, which is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka from August 21st to 25th 2023!\n\n\n\n(From left to right and top to bottom) Liana Jacinta presenting at the APAN55 General Assembly, Rajan Parajuli presenting at the APAN55 General Assembly, All the Fellows at APAN55 General Assembly, Some highlights from behind-the-scenes of organising APAN55, APAN56 official launch presentation"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nBayesian inference methods are mainly used for parameter estimation and model comparison. Parameter estimation is generally performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm and its variants. Whereas, for performing model comparison, the evidence (a high-dimensional integration of the likelihood over the prior density) is computed. The issue with using MH methods is that they cannot compute this on a usable time-scale which further hinders the use of Bayesian model comparison. As such, a contemporary methodology for computing evidence and posteriors simultaneously is provided by nested sampling (Skilling, 2004 and 2006).\nThe nested sampling algorithm can be used to estimate the evidence integral. The basic algorithm is stated here:\nStep 1. Draw \\(n\\) live points uniformly from the prior.\nStep 2. At iteration \\(i\\), replace the point with the lowest likelihood \\(L_i\\) by a new live point drawn (as in Step 1) with the constraint that its likelihood \\(L &gt; L_i\\).\nStep 3. Estimate the fraction of the prior \\(X_i\\) enclosed by the iso-likelihood contour \\(L_i\\). It is the lowest volume of \\(n\\) volumes drawn uniformly from \\([0, X_{i-1\n}]\\).\nStep 4. Calculate the evidence by quadrature, \\(Z \\approx \\sum_{i = 1} L_i (X_{i-1} - X_i)\\).\nStep 5. \\(X_i\\) satisfies, \\(X_i = t_i X_{i-1}\\), \\(P(t_i) = n t_i^{n-1}\\), and \\(X_0 = 1\\).\nStep 6. Using Step 4 and Step 5, the mean and variance of the random variable \\(Z\\) can be found.\nStep 7. The posterior mass contained within the live points is estimated as, \\(Z_{live} \\approx &lt;L&gt;_{live} X_{live}\\).\nStep 8. Convergence is reached when \\(Z_{live}\\) is some small fraction of \\(Z\\).\nStep 9. The dead points may be used to construct a set of posterior samples for use in parameter estimation.\nThe difficult step in nested sampling is sampling from the prior subject to the hard likelihood constraint \\(L &gt; L_i\\). Numerous variants of nested sampling have been constructed to deal with the likelihood constraint. The prior may be sampled using inverse transform sampling, so that sampling occurs in a unit hypercube. How one samples in this space under the hard likelihood constraint is where variations of the algorithm differ.\nThe NestedSamplers.jl Julia package is now enabled to have the random staggering (v0.4.0), slicing and random slicing (v0.5.0) algorithms to propose new live points within a bounding volume in unit space. Uniform and random walk algorithms were released in v0.3.0 of NestedSamplers.jl. Depending on the number of parameters to fit, the proposal algorithm is selected (this not a rule of thumb, rather it is used to acheive optimal algorithm performance). The number of parameters to fit defines the dimensionality of the prior volume used in evidence sampling. These parameters are denoted by ndims . The conditional statement that helps select amongst the proposals is:\nif proposal === :auto\n  proposal = if ndims &lt; 10\n    Proposals.Uniform()\n  elseif 10 ≤ ndims ≤ 20\n    Proposals.RWalk()\n  else\n    Proposals.Slice()\n  end\nend\nAlthough the algorithms can be used for any dimensionality (the value of ndims), their performance will be best when they are selected according to the value of ndims as stated above. Random staggering, slicing and random slicing algorithms are discussed in the further sections."

    "text": "Random Staggering\nRandom staggering can be used as an alternative to the random walk proposal when the number of parameters to fit lie in [10, 20] . However, it differs from the random walk proposal in that the step size here is exponentially adjusted to reach a target acceptance rate during each proposal, in addition to between proposals. In this algorithm, a new live point is proposed by random staggering away from an existing live point. The parameters for this proposal are:\n\nratio: the target acceptance ratio (must be in [1/walks, 1])\nwalks: the minimum number of steps to take (must be greater than 1)\nscale: the proposal distribution scale, which will update between proposals (must be non-negative)\n\nA mutable struct RStagger is constructed with default values ratio = 0.5, walks = 25, and scale = 1.0.\nWhile the number of function calls used to generate the sample is less than the walks (default walks are 25) or the acceptance value is zero, a proposed point is obtained.\nThe position of the initial sample (or the existing live point) is transformed to the proposal distribution, for which the scale and the stagger values (default stagger = 1) are utilized. Whether this transformed value lies inside the unit-cube is verified using the unitcheck function. Checks are also applied on the scale factor to avoid over-shrinking and, on the walks to avoid getting stuck in inefficient random number generation.\nA prior_transform function is applied to the sample which lies within the unit-cube. This function transforms the sample from a unit cube to the parameter space of interest according to the prior. The log-likelihood of this value is returned using the function loglike and stored in logl_prop . The log-likelihood logl_prop of the proposed point is compared with the log-likelihood bound logl_star and the log-likelihood of the final proposed point is stored in logl.\nThe stagger value is then adjusted to target an acceptance ratio.\nratio = accept / (accept + reject)\nif ratio &gt; prop.ratio\n  stagger *= exp(1 / accept)\nelseif ratio &lt; prop.ratio\n  stagger /= exp(1 / reject)\nend\nFinally the proposal scale is updated using the target acceptance ratio, similar to that in the random walk proposal.\nfunction update_scale!(prop, accept, reject, n)\n    ratio = accept / (accept + reject)\n    norm = max(prop.ratio, 1 - prop.ratio) * n\n    scale = prop.scale * exp((ratio - prop.ratio) / norm)\n    prop.scale = min(scale, sqrt(n))\n    return prop\nend"

    "text": "Slicing\nWhen the number of parameters to fit are greater than 20, the slice proposal algorithm can be used. A new live point is proposed by a series of slices away from an existing live point. This is a standard Gibbs-like implementation where a single multivariate slice is a combination of univariate slices through each axis. The parameters for this proposal are:\n\nslices: the minimum number of slices (must be greater than or equal to 1)\nscale: the proposal distribution scale, which will update between proposals (must be non-negative)\n\nA mutable struct Slice is constructed with default values slices = 5 and scale = 1.0.\nA matrix is stored in axes which is used to propose new points. New positions for slices are proposed along the orthogonal basis defined by axes:\naxes = Bounds.axes(bounds)\naxes = prop.scale .* axes'\nThe axis order is shuffled and these shuffled indices are used to select axis for slice sampling:\nidxs = shuffle!(rng, collect(Base.axes(axes, 1)))\nfor idx in idxs:\n  axis = axes[idx, :]    # axis selection\n  # sample_slice function here\nend\nThe procedure for slice sampling is stored in the function sample_slice. To define a starting window, a left bound u_l and a right bound u_r is computed as:\nu_l = @. u - r * axis  # left bound\nu_r = u_l .+ axis # right bound\nHere, u is the position of the final proposed point within the unit cube and r is the initial offset. Unitchecks are performed on both u_l and u_r, on passing which the prior_transform function is applied to transform them to the target parameter space, stored in v_l and v_r, respectively. The log-likelihood of these are stored in logl_l and logl_r, respectively. If these log-likelihoods exceed the log-likelihood bound logl_star, the values of u_land u_r are modified as:\nu_l .-= axis\nu_r .+= axis\nThen the same steps of unitchecks, prior transforms and log-likelihood computations are repeated as earlier.\nThe values of u_l and u_r are used to compute a sample within limits. If the sample is not valid, the limits are shrunk until the logl_star bound is hit. The window size is defined as:\nwindow_init = norm(u_r - u_l)\nThe difference in u_r and u_l is stored in u_hat and a new position is proposed as:\nu_prop = @. u_l + r * u_hat\nThis is passed through the unitchecks, prior transformations and log-likelihood computations and if the log-likelihood boundary condition is met then then move is made to the new position. Otherwise, the new point is subjected to further checks. A variable s is calculated to check the signs as:\ns = dot(u_prop - u, u_hat)\nChecking the sign of s essentially means to check if the new point is to the left or right of the original point along the proposal axis and update the bounds accordingly:\nif s &lt; 0    # left\n  u_l = u_prop\nelseif s &gt; 0    # right\n  u_r = u_prop\nelse\n  error(\"Slice sampler has failed to find a valid point.\")\nend\nFinally the proposal scale is updated based on the relative size of the slices compared to the initial guess.\nprop.scale = prop.scale * nexpand / (2.0 * ncontract)"

    "text": "Also posted on Software Sustainability Institute’s blog.\nFounded in 2009, the Fab Foundation emerged to promote and support the growth of the worldwide fab lab network and the creation of regional capacity-building organisations. Originating from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms Fab Lab programme, the foundation’s mission is centred on providing access to tools, knowledge, and financial resources to facilitate education, innovation, and invention through technology and digital fabrication. This empowers individuals to create (almost) anything, opening up opportunities to improve lives and livelihoods on a global scale. The primary recipients of the Fab Foundation’s support are community organisations, educational institutions, and non-profit entities.\nTo raise awareness about the Fab community, the Fab Foundation organises various events worldwide, and in July 2023, I had the chance to participate in one such event: FAB23 in Thimphu, Bhutan. Besides exploring the Fab community, my purpose in attending this event was to gain insights into the intersections between the Fab community and the Research Software community. Throughout the conference, I attended three workshops in the Technology (R&D) track which helped me understand how (research) software plays an important role in the Fab community.\nThe first hands-on workshop was titled “The quest for the data workbench; a journey from Bhutan to Jupyter (and back), challenged by Pythons and Pandas” led by Pieter van der Hijden. The motivation for this workshop originated from the insights gained at the “Fablabs and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” Working Group, focusing on the role of data in driving machines, managing fablabs, overseeing the Fab Lab network, and examining the environment to identify areas where a positive impact can be achieved. During the session, participants from a variety of fablabs and backgrounds engaged in collaborative learning, each working on their Jupyter Notebook to explore interactive Python, Pandas, Markdown documentation, and develop a simple application. The session concluded with the sharing of thoughts, findings, and discussions on how to offer mutual support in the future.\nFollowing this session, we invited Pieter as a guest for RSE Asia’s community call where he led a discussion on “The Quest for the Data Workbench: How to bridge the gap between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Fablab/Maker Movement?”\nThe second workshop at FAB23 that centred on software implementation was titled “Building smart projects with TinyML using EdgeImpulse and Blues Wireless,” organised by Salman Faris for those interested in the intersection of machine learning and electronics. This workshop delved into the concepts of TinyML, focusing on deploying machine learning models on microcontrollers with limited resources. The session included a discussion on how TinyML can enhance intelligence and autonomy in various electronic devices, spanning wearables, smart sensors, IoT devices, and more. Exploring the EdgeImpulse platform, participants were introduced to its user-friendly interface for designing and training TinyML models. The workshop covered aspects such as collecting and preprocessing sensor data, creating machine learning models using popular algorithms, and evaluating their performance. Techniques for optimising TinyML models for deployment on resource-constrained microcontrollers were also discussed. Practical examples illustrated how TinyML and electronics can be combined for projects like gesture recognition, voice-controlled devices, environmental sensing, and others. Step-by-step demonstrations were provided to showcase the integration of TinyML models trained with EdgeImpulse into electronic prototypes, showcasing the potential of this combination.\nThe third hands-on workshop titled “How to add machine learning to almost anything?” was organised by Eric Pan and Violet Su. During this workshop, participants delved into machine learning applications on the widely used embedded AI device, Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense. This compact yet powerful tool serves as an ideal entry point for those venturing into intelligent voice and vision AI. Attendees received a unit of XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, enabling them to explore the world of embedded AI. The workshop offered an introduction to various projects leveraging embedded AI, hands-on experiences to test different functionalities, and provided inspiration, insights, and resources to empower participants to construct their own models for future embedded AI projects."

    "text": "Sessions during the conference\nA number of different sessions were conducted during the conference like training, workshops, unconference tracks, birds of a feather, posters, lightning talks, hackathon, walkthroughs, etc.. The keynote by Dr Gaël Varoquaux titled “Saving the world one line at a time?!” was a reflection on the successes and failures of open computational science to make a better society. Another Keynote by Daniel S. Katz was on the “State of the US-RSE”. There were several training sessions and workshops conducted during the conference. The talk “Is RSE coming of age” given by Neil Chue Hong focused on how research software engineering can be meaningful and relevant to society. The plenary panel session brought together members of the RSEng community to share their experiences of RSE work across industry, national laboratories, charity, and the public sector. This panel explored the similarities and differences between the sectors, particularly in comparison to a university setting. The underlying aim of this panel was to showcase alternative careers to the more traditional RSE roles within an RSE team or embedded within a university research group."

This session was facilitated by Claire Wyatt. The purpose of this session was to update the RSE community about the advancement of international RSE Groups and the advancement of the recognition and importance of Research Software in different countries. This session was divided into two parts. In the first part speakers from different regions (Africa, UK, South Africa, Germany, Asia, US, Netherlands and eScience Center) provided their updates. The second part focused on international RSE community building. During this session, Lou Woodley from the CSCCE talked us through some of the fundamentals of building a community of practice, and what works and what doesn’t! The agenda for this session also included the launch of a “How-to handbook on international RSE community building” (Collaborative community notes for the handbook). However, due to time constraints, it was not launched during this session."

    "text": "Abstract\nReproducibility of scientific research enables others including your future self to validate, extend, and build upon analytical results. This in turn, helps build confidence in the results of scientific analyses. However, reproducibility is not a binary concept, rather, there is a scale from less reproducible to more reproducible, where various tools and practices can help enhance it.\nThe R package {targets}, developed and maintained by Will Landau, is a workflow management package designed to increase reproducibility in R based data analysis. The major features of {targets} include automation of workflows, caching of intermediate steps, batch creation of workflow steps, and parallelisation at the level of the workflow. These features not only help to reproduce scientific analysis, but also help you to tackle several other challenges in your research workflows. For example, it supports you to return to a project after working on something else and still be able to immediately pick up where you left off without confusion or trying to remember what you were doing. If you change the workflow, then you only have to re-run the parts that are affected by the change. It is also possible to scale up the workflow, to say, handle large datasets, without changing the underlying individual functions.\nThis session will provide an introduction to using {targets} for reproducible data analysis in R. Participants will learn how to structure their workflows to make their data analysis more reproducible in R."
