Those who are interested in learning about beginner-level resources for “contributing to R” would also benefit from this talk.\nThe expected outcome of this talk would be that the audience will get an idea of using the Carpentries Workbench template for their teaching and/or learning purposes.

Initially drafted in 2021 with the support of the R Foundation, the guide has undergone significant revisions, notably during the Google Season of Docs 2022. The presentation will cover the guide’s evolution and its role in fostering a more inclusive and collaborative environment. Attendees (seasoned or new contributors to R) will gain insights into leveraging the R Dev Guide for effectively contributing to the R project and/or for further enhancements to the guide itself. The session aims to develop attendees’ skills in navigating the R project and collaborating with a global community. The evolution of the guide reflects a broader commitment to fostering an inclusive community and democratising the process of contributing to the R project. It would provide a pathway for attendees seeking to contribute to open-source and engage with the global R community. This presentation will help start discussions on continuous learning and community collaboration within software development."

    "text": "Description\n\nDescription\nThe R Development Guide (R Dev Guide) serves as a comprehensive resource to facilitate the onboarding process for new contributors to the R project. Its initial draft emerged in 2021 which was made possible through a funding from the R Foundation. Subsequently, a significant update took place during Google Season of Docs (GSoD) 2022. This update involved the inclusion of new chapters and sections, addressing important aspects such as translations, adopting a git workflow for proposed patches, and providing novice-friendly instructions on installing R from source. Work has continued post-GSoD 2022, to implement further updates and improvements, many in response to feedback on earlier versions. This talk reviews the current status of the guide, shedding light on the positive impact it has had on the R community, particularly among new contributors. With the enhancements to the Guide, contributing has become more accessible, especially for newcomers, compared to relying solely on the official documentation. The talk aims to showcase the evolving nature of the guide and underscore its role in fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for those engaging with the R project."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nReproducibility of scientific research enables others including your future self to validate, extend, and build upon analytical results. This in turn, helps build confidence in the results of scientific analyses. However, reproducibility is not a binary concept, rather, there is a scale from less reproducible to more reproducible, where various tools and practices can help enhance it.\nThe R package {targets}, developed and maintained by Will Landau, is a workflow management package designed to increase reproducibility in R based data analysis. The major features of {targets} include automation of workflows, caching of intermediate steps, batch creation of workflow steps, and parallelisation at the level of the workflow. These features not only help to reproduce scientific analysis, but also help you to tackle several other challenges in your research workflows. For example, it supports you to return to a project after working on something else and still be able to immediately pick up where you left off without confusion or trying to remember what you were doing. If you change the workflow, then you only have to re-run the parts that are affected by the change. It is also possible to scale up the workflow, to say, handle large datasets, without changing the underlying individual functions.\nThis session will provide an introduction to using {targets} for reproducible data analysis in R. Participants will learn how to structure their workflows to make their data analysis more reproducible in R."
