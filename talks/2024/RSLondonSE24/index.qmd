## Abstract

The R Development Guide (R Dev Guide) is a resource designed to onboard new contributors to the R project, making the transition smoother and more accessible. Initially drafted in 2021 with the support of the R Foundation, the guide has undergone significant revisions, notably during the Google Season of Docs 2022. The presentation will cover the guide's evolution and its role in fostering a more inclusive and collaborative environment. Attendees (seasoned or new contributors to R) will gain insights into leveraging the R Dev Guide for effectively contributing to the R project and/or for further enhancements to the guide itself. The session aims to develop attendees' skills in navigating the R project and collaborating with a global community. The evolution of the guide reflects a broader commitment to fostering an inclusive community and democratising the process of contributing to the R project. It would provide a pathway for attendees seeking to contribute to open-source and engage with the global R community. This presentation will help start discussions on continuous learning and community collaboration within software development.
