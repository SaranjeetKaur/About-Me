This session was presented at the [Bristol R User Group meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bristol-r-user-group/events/304432981/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) in July 2025.

## Abstract

When working with data, it's common to generate the same report multiple times, each with different parameters, such as dates, datasets, or regions. Manually updating and duplicating reports can be time-consuming and prone to error. In this session, I will introduce parameterised reporting using Quarto, an open-source system for scientific and technical publishing. You'll learn how to automate the generation of multiple versions of the same report, without copying and pasting.

## Bonus

We will also explore how to create branded reports using [brand.yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/), ensuring consistency across all your documents.

## Who Should Attend?

This session is ideal for anyone who works with data and produces reports. Basic familiarity with R will be helpful, but is not required.
