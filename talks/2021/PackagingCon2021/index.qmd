## Abstract

[Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) is a Julia library focusing on Bayesian inference with probabilistic programming. It has a special focus on modularity, and it decouples the modelling language and inference methods. This talk highlights the features of Turing.jl. Furthermore, references are provided to tutorials for working with Turing.

Presented a lightning talk on “Turing.jl: An Overview”. The talk was an overview of Turing.jl which is a Julia library focusing on Bayesian inference with probabilistic programming. This was the first edition of PackagingCon 2021, which is a conference held with the aim to bring various software ecosystems together.
