Presented a regular talk in the ‘1A Community and Outreach 1’ session on the ‘R Developer’s Guide’ (now called as the ‘[R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/)’) at [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org) (online).

During the conference, I also attended the tutorials on ‘Contributing to R’ (conducted by Gabriel Becker and Martin Maechler) and ‘Translating R to Your Language’ (conducted by Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence). I was also the Zoom Host for various tutorials and sessions of this international online conference.
