In the ‘1A Community and Outreach 1’ session of useR! 2021, I presented a talk on the ‘R Developer’s Guide’ (now called as the '[R Development Guide](https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide)'). During the conference, I also attended the tutorials on ‘Contributing to R’ (conducted by Gabriel Becker and Martin Maechler) and ‘Translating R to Your Language’ (conducted by Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence). I was also the Zoom Host for various tutorials and sessions of this international online conference.
