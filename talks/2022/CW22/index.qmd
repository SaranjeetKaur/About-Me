Presented a lightning talk on “RSE Asia Association: In making” at the [Collaborations Workshop 2022](https://www.software.ac.uk/workshop/collaborations-workshop-2022-cw22-0) hosted by the Software Sustainability Institute.

Also presented a pitch to build a Carpentries-style Lesson on R's Bug Tracking Process which secured the 3rd position on the Hack Day. As a part of this task we converted the materials from the Collaboration Campfires (on learning how to contribute to R) into a reusable lesson using The Carpentries Workbench template and the R package sandpaper. The lesson created is hosted on the [r-devel GitHub organisation](https://github.com/r-devel/r-bug-tracking-lesson).
