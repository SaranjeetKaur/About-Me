## Abstract

Open science helps in creating reproducible resources in a transparent manner, which further improves inclusion and fairness in the process. In this talk I share the benefits of following open science principles in community building work that I learnt during my participation in the Cohort-4 of the Open Life Science Programme (OLS-4). These principles can be applied to research and community work in many domains.
