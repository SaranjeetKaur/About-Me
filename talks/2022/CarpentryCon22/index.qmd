## Abstract

This talk will provide a dive into how reusable R Markdown lessons can be created using the [Carpentries Workbench template](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-rmd). Lessons on [R’s bug tracking process](https://github.com/r-devel/r-bug-tracking-lesson)) and [R’s translations process](https://github.com/r-devel/r-translations-lesson)), created using the Workbench template will be demonstrated during this talk. Both these lessons are inspired from the materials of the [Collaboration Campfires](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/collaboration-campfires). \
\
The intended audience for this talk would include Instructors and Learners who are interested in using the Carpentries Workbench template for teaching and/or learning purposes. Those who are interested in learning about beginner-level resources for “contributing to R” would also benefit from this talk.

The expected outcome of this talk would be that the audience will get an idea of using the Carpentries Workbench template for their teaching and/or learning purposes. Instructors will also be introduced to a tool for creating neatly structured lesson template(s).
